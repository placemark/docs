Body: <p>TopoJSON is "an extension of <a
  href="/documentation/geojson">GeoJSON</a> that encodes topology." TopoJSON is
  typically a more compact way to represent data than GeoJSON, because shared
  borders between polygons can be represented as one line 'arc' rather two
  overlapping edges. TopoJSON also includes tools for doing simplification using
  this topology information, so that if you simplify a map of contiguous areas,
  like states or countries, shared borders are not
  corrupted.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li><a

  specification</a></li></ul>

Summary: An extension of GeoJSON that encodes topology in order to save space.
