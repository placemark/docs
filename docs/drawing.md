Body: "<p>Placemark supports drawing all of the standard geometry types: lines,
  points, and polygons. Click one of the drawing modes on the top-left bar to
  start drawing. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to enter each drawing mode:
  the numbers 1-5 will select each mode.</p><p><a
  href=\"/documentation/geojson\">GeoJSON</a> and several other file types
  support multi-features, which let multiple lines, points, or polygons share
  the same properties. Drawing a feature on the map will always draw a single
  feature, but if you draw a feature and select it and some other feature, a
  'link' icon will appear in the top bar that lets you combine those features
  into a multi feature. If the features are of different geometry types, they'll
  be combined into a GeometryCollection.</p><h4>Drawing rectangles</h4><p>You
  can click the square drawing tool to draw a rectangle, and then draw by
  clicking and dragging. Holding shift while drawing a rectangle will constrain
  the shape to a square, in map coordinates.</p><p>Rectangles aren't persisted,
  currently, so modifying them after drawing will not retain their right
  angles.</p>"
