Body: "<p>GeoJSON is a format for geospatial data. It's based on the <a
  href=\"https://www.json.org/json-en.html\">JSON</a> format, and extremely
  popular in web mapping. Because it's a kind of JSON, you can parse GeoJSON
  easily in most programming languages.</p><p>GeoJSON is most similar, in terms
  of capabilities, to the Shapefile and KML formats: it can store both geometry
  and properties in the same file. Unlike KML, GeoJSON doesn't specify how to
  store styling information, so you can't store a \"blue polygon\", for example
  - you can only store \"a polygon.\" However, an additional specification
  called <a href=\"/documentation/geojson\">simplestyle</a> does define how you
  can store styles in GeoJSON, and you can view simplestyle-styled features in
  Placemark.</p><p><a href=\"/documentation/topojson\">TopoJSON</a> was inspired
  by GeoJSON and can be used to store some features more efficiently than
  GeoJSON itself.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li><a
