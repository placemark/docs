Body: <p>Placemark supports many different types of property values. Any value
  that's valid <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> can be the
  value of a property. So that includes the following:</p><ul><li>string
  (text)</li><li>numbers</li><li>boolean (true and
  false)</li><li>null</li><li>arrays &amp; objects</li></ul><p>So, for example -
  you could have a "height" attribute with numeric values, a "name" attribute
  with string values, and a "tags" attribute that is an array.</p><h4>Types are
  flexible in Placemark</h4><p>In contrast to systems that are based on strict
  data tables, the types of your attributes in Placemark are not constrained by
  a schema:&nbsp;one feature can have a "name" that's a string, and another
  feature can have a "name" attribute that's an array of numbers.</p><p>This
  flexibility can be powerful, and is necessary because many formats support
  mixed values.</p><h4>Default types</h4><p>Placemark chooses a type to use by
  default when you initially set an attribute. </p>
