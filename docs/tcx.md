Body: <p>TCX, or Training Center XML, is a file format used and popularized by
  <a href="https://www.garmin.com/">Garmin</a> to share activity data, usually
  from GPS smart watches. It's typically used for sharing data about runs,
  hikes, cycling, and other outdoor activities. TCX is similar to <a
  href="/documentation/gpx">GPX</a>, but can contain more sport-specific
  activity details.</p><h4>Using the TCX&nbsp;format</h4><p>Placemark can import
  the TCX&nbsp;format, turning its routes into lines and trackpoints into
  points. We can't currently export the format because Placemark supports many
  features that TCX does not.</p><h4>Technical details</h4><p>The Placemark team
  maintains and uses the <a
  href="https://github.com/placemark/togeojson">toGeoJSON</a> JavaScript library
  to import TCX files.</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li><a
