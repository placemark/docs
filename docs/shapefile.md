Body: <p>The shapefile, or ESRI Shapefile, is an old and popular file format
  that's supported by most desktop GIS&nbsp;systems, but is rarely used directly
  in web maps. Shapefiles can be a moderately efficient way to transfer larger
  amounts of spatial data, but they have quirks and limitations that you should
  be wary of:</p><ul><li>A shapefile is not one file, but a collection of files
  - typically .shp, .dbf, and .prj, but there are more than 10 different files
  that are often also included in the group.</li><li>The data attached to a
  shapefile, contained in the .dbf file, limits the length of attribute names
  and values to 255 characters.</li><li>A given shapefile can only contain one
  kind of feature, whether point, polygon, or linestring.</li></ul><p>Placemark
  supports shapefiles as a .zip file containing .shp, .dbf, and .prj, or as
  those files dropped or selected into the map in one
  operation.</p><p>References</p><ul><li><a

  Wikipedia</a></li></ul>

Summary: The shapefile is an old, popular, and limited file format that
  Placemark supports the import and export of.
