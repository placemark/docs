One thing that makes maps unique is their dimensionality. Geospatial data can be seen as a table of attributes, a tree structure of features and folders, as rendered shapes, as code, or in aggregate statistics. Placemark embraces this paradigm by giving you multiple views into your data, all synced and updated in real-time.

‍

So one of the most important features we have is the **Table view**. The theory of Placemark's table is that it should be as powerful as possible, as close to a spreadsheet as we can get, but still integrated into the complexity of geospatial data. A lot of people spend a *lot* of time using the table. So it made sense to add a way to really center the table and make it a primary part of the UI. Today, that's becoming a lot better, with **Layouts**.

‍

There are now three layouts, that you can select from a menu in the top-right of the map. The three serve complimentary purposes:

### Default

This is the old-fashioned layout, which you’ve been using so far. It shows the structured list of features on the left, which you can use to organize features into folders and change their order in the map. You can resize the left and right panels, or hide them entirely to interact with a full-screen map.

‍

### Floating

This view makes the table the star of the show and places the map as a draggable, resizable popup over the screen. This way you can interact with the table and see the maximum amount of attribute data.

‍

### Vertical

This view shows the map at the top of the screen, and the attribute table below it. Perfect for small screens (this is the default view when you open Placemark on a phone), or for work that requires both deep attribute editing and some geospatial awareness. In this view, you can also resize the split, to show as much or as little map or table as you'd like.
