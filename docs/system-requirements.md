  installation step.</p><h4>Supported browsers</h4><ul><li>The application works
  best with Chrome or Firefox-based browsers.</li><li>Internet Explorer is not
  supported.</li><li>Firefox private mode is not supported, because in private
  mode Firefox does not support cookies or IndexedDB.</li></ul><h4>Technology

  NoScript extensions or any browser without JavaScript
  support.</li><li>IndexedDB support is required. IndexedDB is, by default,

  requirements.</li><li>Cookies must be enabled to log into Placemark, because
  they are used to manage your authenticated session.</li><li>WebGL is required.
  Check the <a href="https://get.webgl.org/">WebGL&nbsp;test</a> to confirm that
