Body: "<p>WKT, or <em>Well-Known Text, </em>is a text-based format for
  geospatial data. It's very common in databases. Unlike formats like <a
  href=\"/documentation/geojson\">GeoJSON</a> or <a
  href=\"/documentation/kml\">KML</a>, WKT can only store one feature at a time
  and has no way to store properties: formats that use WKT store properties in
  another way, like in other columns of a database table. In this sense, it's
  similar to the <a href=\"/documentation/polyline\">Polyline</a> format, which
  can only store a single line - but WKT&nbsp;can store any kind of
  geometry.</p><p>Here's an example of a line encoded as
  WKT:</p><div></div><p>WKT is often stored and sometimes transferred as WKB, a
  binary version of the same format that has additional geometry types and is
  much more efficient to store and process.</p><ul><li><a

Summary: A text-based format that doesn't have the ability to contain attributes
