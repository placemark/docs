  you export from Placemark in d3-geo and encountering issues, set the winding
  order to \"D3\"&nbsp;when you export.</p><h4 id=\"\">What is winding
  order?</h4><p id=\"\">Winding order is the order of the coordinates along the
  ring of a polygon geometry. Some specifications require these coordinates to
  be ordered clockwise, others counter-clockwise. Winding order can be useful in
  some narrow circumstances to determine what's the \"outside\" of a Polygon (or
  MultiPolygon) and what is the inside.</p><h4 id=\"\">The Winding Order
  Option</h4><p id=\"\">Placemark gives you the choice of winding order for one
  format: GeoJSON. Other formats are either unopinionated about winding order or
  have a well-established standard for which order in which to wind
  coordinates.</p><p id=\"\">GeoJSON is unique, in that it has three
  ideas:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">In the original GeoJSON specification, there
  was no stipulation of winding order. You could wind rings however you'd
  like.</li><li id=\"\">In the fully-standardized revised
  GeoJSON&nbsp;specification (aka <a
  href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946\" id=\"\">RFC 7946</a>),
  polygons should follow the right-hand rule - exterior rings are
  counterclockwise, interior clockwise. However, for backward-compatibility,
  this is not required. Polygons with differently-wound coordinates should still
  work fine.</li><li id=\"\">The <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-geo\"
  id=\"\">d3-geo</a> tools require the <strong id=\"\">opposite</strong> of the
  specification - exterior rings should be clockwise wound. And if you have them
  incorrectly wound, then many functions in d3-geo will not function
  properly.</li></ul><h4>Spherical polygons</h4><p>The reason why d3-geo is so
  particular about winding order is that it supports spherical polygons -
  polygons that might cover the whole earthâ€™s surface except for one small area.
  Imagine a polygon of all the earth except for a city outline:&nbsp;in this
  case the outer ring of that polygon has the same coordinates as a polygon
  covering just the city, but the polygon should be interpreted as everything
  <em>except</em> that area. Using winding order you can represent this.
  Placemark currently doesn't support this kind of polygon - you can represent
  this instead by creating a polygon with an outer ring of the full world extent
  and an inner ring of the city's shape.</p>"
