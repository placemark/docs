Body: <p>The GeoTIFF&nbsp;file format is an extension of the established <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF">TIFF format</a> that adds the
  ability for the image data to be georeferenced:&nbsp;for the corners of the
  image to be assigned geographical locations so that it can be placed on a
  map.</p><p>GeoTIFF&nbsp;is a <a href="/documentation/raster-data">raster file
  format</a> - storing images, rather than shapes. Placemark primarily deals in
  vector data - data that's composed of shapes. So GeoTIFF import is relatively
  limited:&nbsp;Placemark can read a GeoTIFF&nbsp;image and extract the
  geographical bounds of the image, which can be useful for quickly knowing
  where a GeoTIFF&nbsp;will be located on a map. The tool does not export or
  edit GeoTIFFs.</p><p>GeoTIFF support is similar to <a
  href="/documentation/exif">EXIF</a>&nbsp;support in Placemark, though GeoTIFFs
  contain bounding boxes and EXIF data only includes a single point for where
  the photo was taken.</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li>‚Äç<a

Summary: GeoTIFF is a format for spatial raster data, like images from
  satellites or airplanes. Placemark supports importing the bounding box from a
  GeoTIFF image, and there are many other tools to process GeoTIFF images more
  completely.
