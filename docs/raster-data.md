Body: <p>Placemark doesn't support editing, creating, or analyzing raster data.
  We recommend tools like <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a> to
  work with raster data, or if you'd like to write scripts and software to work
  with that data, the <a
  href="https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">rasterio</a> Python
  library.</p><p>Placemark does support importing<em> </em>metadata from two
  kinds of raster data sources:&nbsp;<a href="/documentation/exif">EXIF</a>,
  which is usually embedded in JPEG&nbsp;photos taken by cellphones with GPS,
  and <a href="/documentation/geotiff">GeoTIFF</a>, which is a standard format
  for satellite, terrain, and other kinds of earth observation data.
  EXIF&nbsp;data contains points and GeoTIFF&nbsp;data contains bounding boxes
  that can be extracted and displayed on the map.</p>
Category: formats
Summary: Pixel-oriented data, often with many color and spectrum bands.
