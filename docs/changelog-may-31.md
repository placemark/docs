This week's changelog has two headline features!

* **The table view is more user-friendly and flexible**. Columns are better sized to fit their contents, cells are bigger, and you can resize columns if you want. We're aiming for this to be the best attribute editing experience in maps, and this is a step in that direction.

This river is called - you guessed correctly - Umea

* **Feature labels on the map!** This one was heavily requested. You can now select a property from your data that'll be shown on the map as each feature's label. This works for all the geometry types - polygons and points are labeled in their centers, lines are labeled along the line.

That's it for this week, but there's lots more soon.
