Body: '<p>CSV, or comma-separated values, is a common way to store tabular data.
  You can often import and export CSV files with spreadsheet and database
  software. Not all CSV files have geospatial data: they are usually just
  tables. Placemark supports different kinds of
  CSV&nbsp;files:</p><ul><li>Longitude, latitude data that is read as a point
  per row</li><li><a href="/documentation/zip-codes">ZIP&nbsp;Codes</a>, which
  are matched with a database and transformed into points</li></ul><p>TSV files,
  which use tabs to separate columns, and DSV files - delimiter-separated files,
  which can use other separators like ; - are functionally equivalent to CSV
  files. Importing those files is supported in the same way.</p><p>CSV has no
  standardized way to represent data types other than points, so CSV files are
  not traditionally used for data like lines or polygons.</p>'
