Body: <p id="">Hereâ€™s how Placemark relates to a few other things in the world
  of geospatial tools!</p><h3 id="">Mapbox</h3><p id="">Placemark uses a lot of
  pieces from <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" id="">Mapbox</a> - technology
  like <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/" id="">Mapbox GL
  JS</a>, the Mapbox geocoding service, and Mapbox's map tiles for the
  underlying base map. The closest product Mapbox has to Placemark is the
  Dataset editor in Mapbox Studio, which the author of Placemark contributed to.
  Placemark focuses entirely on creating, editing, and publishing data, while
  Mapbox Studio is mainly focused on styling and designing maps.</p><h3
  id="">geojson.io</h3><p id="">The author of Placemark created geojson.io.
  Placemark aims to be the same, but better. Currently, Placemark supports
  formats that geojson.io doesn't, like <a href="/documentation/kmz">KMZ</a> and
  <a href="/documentation/kml" id="">FlatGeobuf</a>, uses fast new vector tile
  technology, supports saving maps the cloud, collaborating on them with your
  team, and sharing them on the site.</p><h3 id="">OpenStreetMap</h3><p id=""><a
  href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" id="">OpenStreetMap</a> provides the map
  data that you see in Mapbox's base maps, as well as lots of other places on
  the internet. OpenStreetMap (OSM) allows map editing through the iD editor
  (which the creator of Placemark also worked on in its early stages), but the
  OpenStreetMap map is public, shared between everyone, and strictly refers to
  certain kinds of data like streets and businesses.</p><p id="">Placemark can
  support any type of data and is intended to be used for private data as
  well.</p><h3 id="">QGIS</h3><p id=""><a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/"
  id="">QGIS</a> is a powerful desktop tool for editing maps. It's open source
  and great, but can be a little intimidating to use. Placemark is meant to be
  simpler and easier to get started with. You might want to use both QGIS and
  Placemark if you need more advanced analysis.</p><h3 id="">ArcGIS</h3><p
  id=""><a href="https://www.arcgis.com/index.html" id="">ArcGIS</a> is similar
  to QGIS, but is an older proprietary product. It tends to be more expensive,
  but is powerful. Unfortunately, ArcGIS promotes and supports proprietary
  formats.</p>
