### Your Account

* You must create and log into an account to use some features of the website.

### Your Content

* Nothing in these terms gives the *operator* any ownership rights in content or intellectual property that you share with the website, such as your account information and content you submit to the website. Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the *operator*'s content or intellectual property, either.

These terms do not obligate the *operator* to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit.
* Content you submit to the website belongs to you, and you decide how to license it to others. But at a minimum, you license the *operator* to provide content that you submit to the website to other users of the website. That special license allows the *operator* to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the website.
* When content you submit is removed from the website, whether by you or by the *operator*, the *operator*'s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the *operator*'s backups, caches, and other systems. Other licenses you give for your content may continue after your content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or the *operator* itself, the right to share your content through the website again.
* Others who receive content you submit to the website may violate the terms on which you license your content. You agree that the *operator* will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.

If the *operator* fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won't have to reimburse the *operator* for costs that you could have defended against or lessened with prompt notice. You agree to allow the *operator* to take over investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims you would have to reimburse the *operator* for, and to cooperate with those efforts. The *operator* agrees not to enter any settlement that admits you were at fault or requires you to do anything without your permission.

* Both sides agree to bring legal any proceedings related to this agreement only in the national and any national-subdivision courts located in the *forum for disputes*. If the *operator* doesn't say what the *forum for disputes* is, it's the city with state and federal courts in the state of the *governing law* that is closest to where the *operator* is based. If the *operator* isn't based in that state, the *forum for disputes* is the capital of that state.
* Neither you nor the *operator* will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.
* If the *governing law* allows, both sides waive their rights to trial by jury.
