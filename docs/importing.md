Body: <p>Placemark supports a wide variety of standard geospatial data formats,
  and a few different ways of importing them onto the map.</p><p>To import a
  file you can:</p><ul><li>Click the menu in the top-left and select
  <strong>Open…</strong>. This will let you open a file from your
  computer.</li><li>Click the menu in the top-left and click <strong>Paste
  text</strong>. This will open a dialog that lets you add data from text. This
  is often useful if you’re importing a small text file like a <a
  href="/documentation/csv">CSV</a> and want to copy it into the map without
  saving it as a file.</li><li>Drag the file from a folder on your computer onto
  the map. This should show a temporary "Drop here" note. When you drop the file
  on the map, you'll see the import dialog.</li></ul><p>You can import
  <strong>multiple files</strong> by dropping multiple files on the map, or
  selecting multiple files through the <strong>Open…</strong>option! You'll need
  to click-through the Import dialog for each file, just in case a particular
  file has different import options.</p>
