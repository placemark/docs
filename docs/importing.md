Summary: Pulling text, files, and API data onto the map.

---

Placemark supports a wide variety of standard geospatial data formats, and a few different ways of importing them onto the map.

To import a file you can:

* Click the menu in the top-left and select **Open…**. This will let you open a file from your computer.
* Click the menu in the top-left and click **Paste text**. This will open a dialog that lets you add data from text. This is often useful if you’re importing a small text file like a [CSV](/documentation/csv) and want to copy it into the map without saving it as a file.
* Drag the file from a folder on your computer onto the map. This should show a temporary "Drop here" note. When you drop the file on the map, you'll see the import dialog.

You can import **multiple files** by dropping multiple files on the map, or selecting multiple files through the **Open…**option! You'll need to click-through the Import dialog for each file, just in case a particular file has different import options.
