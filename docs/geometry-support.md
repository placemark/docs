Summary: About the types of geometries that Placemark supports - including
  Point, LineString, and Polygon.

---

Placemark aims to support the full range of geometries in [GeoJSON](/documentation/geojson), with possible extensions in the future. These include:

* Points & MultiPoints
* Polygons & MultiPolygons
* LineStrings & MultiLineStrings
* GeometryCollection

GeoJSON doesn't include support for a few other sorts of geometries, including circles and curves, and neither does Placemark at the present - if these things are important to you, please contact us or ask in the community!
