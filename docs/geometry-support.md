Body: <p>Placemark aims to support the full range of geometries in <a
  href="/documentation/geojson">GeoJSON</a>, with possible extensions in the
  future. These include:</p><ul><li>Points
  &amp;&nbsp;MultiPoints</li><li>Polygons
  &amp;&nbsp;MultiPolygons</li><li>LineStrings
  &amp;&nbsp;MultiLineStrings</li><li>GeometryCollection</li></ul><p>GeoJSON
  doesn't include support for a few other sorts of geometries, including circles
  and curves, and neither does Placemark at the present - if these things are
  important to you, please contact us or ask in the community!</p>
