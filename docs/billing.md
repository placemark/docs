Body: <p>Here's how billing works with Placemark.</p><p>You pay monthly by
  people in an organization. When you sign up, you get a default organization.
  Single member organizations pay for that one member.</p><p>You can add as many
  people as you want to your organization to use it with your company or group,
  and you'll pay for the users in that group.</p><p>When a new person is invited
  to an organization and they don't have an existing Placemark account, their
  first organization will be the one they're invited to - so they don't have to
  set up billing and other information.</p><p>If you're removed from your last
  organization, the next time you log in, Placemark will ask you to create a new
  organization.</p>
