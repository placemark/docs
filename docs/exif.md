Body: <p>Exif is a standard for storing additional information in an image file,
  usually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> file.
  Placemark supports extracting Exif data from JPEG files that you drag &amp;
  drop onto the map or <a href="/documentation/importing">import</a> with the
  <strong>Open fileâ€¦</strong> functionality, and showing their geolocation, if
  they have any, on the map.</p><p>For privacy reasons, many JPEG files don't
  contain geospatial Exif data even if the raw image does and the camera has GPS
  hardware.</p><h4>Technical details</h4><p>Placemark's support for importing
  EXIF data is derived from the <a
  href="https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js">exif-js JavaScript module</a>
  implementation of the format.</p><h4>References</h4><ul><li><a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif">Exif on Wikipedia</a></li></ul>
Category: formats
Summary: A kind of geospatial data that's included in some JPEG photos to keep
