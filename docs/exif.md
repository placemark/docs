Summary: A kind of geospatial data that's included in some JPEG photos to keep
  track of where they were taken.

---

Exif is a standard for storing additional information in an image file, usually a [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) file. Placemark supports extracting Exif data from JPEG files that you drag & drop onto the map or [import](/documentation/importing) with the **Open fileâ€¦** functionality, and showing their geolocation, if they have any, on the map.

For privacy reasons, many JPEG files don't contain geospatial Exif data even if the raw image does and the camera has GPS hardware.

#### Technical details

Placemark's support for importing EXIF data is derived from the [exif-js JavaScript module](https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js) implementation of the format.
