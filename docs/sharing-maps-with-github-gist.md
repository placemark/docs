‍

Placemark supports sharing maps using [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), GitHub's simple pastebin service. By connecting your account, you can share any map in a few clicks and use GitHub as a preview or way for your colleagues to see your map.

Gists only support previewing [GeoJSON](/documentation/geojson) files with maps, so any maps shared as a Gist will be shared as GeoJSON.

You can manage your account's connection to GitHub on the Account Settings page, and disconnect from GitHub if you'd like.
