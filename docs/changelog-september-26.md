We've been hard at work on improvements to make Placemark more useful for all your map making needs! Here's what's new this week:

### Sign up without a credit card!

![Hand holding crossed-out credit cards](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61672c738436bb6bb116c6f2/6331f5e364d647362fa54b87_Frame%201%20\(1\).png)

Does what it says on the tin! You can now start a free trial of Placemark without providing a means of payment up front. It's still a paid product, intentionally so to make sure that *you're the customer, not the product*, but if providing a card number up front has been holding you back from signing up, try it out today.

### Share maps as a Gist

‍

In addition to [the ability to share maps on Placemark](https://www.placemark.io/post/sharing-maps) which we introduced recently, you can now share a map as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)! This method of sharing was the only way to share maps using Placemark's predecessor, geojson.io, and it's now part of Placemark too, in a new, more secure, and improved form. You can connect your GitHub account to your Placemark account to get this started.

‍

### Rotate features

‍

‍

A little while ago we introduced [the ability to move features](https://www.placemark.io/post/moving-features) by holding down the Space bar and dragging. Now you can also rotate features, by holding down the Option key (or Alt, on Windows or Linux computers), and dragging! This also works with multi-selections, so you can select multiple features (with the selection lasso, by shift-drag), and rotate all of them using the Option key.
