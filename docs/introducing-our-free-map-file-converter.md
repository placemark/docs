Today I'm releasing [Placemark's free map file converter](https://app.placemark.io/converter). It'll convert your KML to GeoJSON to FlatGeobuf to GeoJSONL. You name it, it converts it. It has no built-in limits: the only limit is your imagination, wait no – your computer and browser's memory.

‍

In the course of implementing [lots and lots of file formats](https://www.placemark.io/format-matrix) in Placemark, we've ended up with some great, reusable tools. I figured it'd be pretty useful to just let anyone use those things, on a convenient drag & drop (or click, or paste) page. I hope it's useful. Happy Friday!

This list will go out of date, but right now - you can convert:

* GeoJSON, GeoJSONL
* FlatGeobuf
* CSV
* Excel
* Zipped ESRI Shapefiles
* GPX
* TCX
* Encoded polylines
* Extract data from GeoTIFFs & JPEGs
* KML & KMZ
