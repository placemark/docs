You can now share maps from Placemark with a colleague or a friend just by dropping a link. They don't need an account - it's just a webpage. Here's an example, [that map of those airports](https://app.placemark.io/public/JtYBdrhcGTBzTt056fyNQ).

### Sharing + analysis

Geometry statistics for a shared map

But it's not just a read-only map. The Placemark DNA is sprinked throughout shared maps. You can check out geometry and property statistics for shared maps.
