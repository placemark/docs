You can now import spreadsheets with addresses and let Placemark turn them into a map! With address data, you can give the geocoder extra context for which part of your spreadsheet is the street, country, postcode, or other part of the address – or you can just point the geocoder to a single field with the address.

Plus, now you can add an address after you've searched for it on the map.

Placemark's support for addresses is pretty special: it's based on open data sources, so you can enrich your data with geo-locations, without needing to worry about licensing. Unfortunately, you can't do the same with most other solutions or even APIs - being able to store addresses is usually a closely-guarded feature.

You can read more about this feature in our new documentation on [importing addresses](/documentation/importing-addresses).
