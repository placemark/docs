Well, I've made the decision to wind down my efforts on [Placemark](https://www.placemark.io/) - it's been a lovely journey thanks to great folks using it (like you!) but ultimately wasn't self-sustaining financially.

Starting today,

* New signups will be disabled
* Existing paid users will have free access until January 19, 2024
* In January 2024 I'll release the full source code for the application as open source

I've intentionally crafted Placemark in a way that was easy to interoperate with other systems, so it should be smooth to export from the application and import into tools like [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/), [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/), [Felt](https://felt.com/), [Carta](https://www.cartamaps.com/), or [Atlas](https://atlas.co/).

If you need help with exporting, or have any other questions, feel free to contact me.

Thank you, folks, for your support and for using Placemark!

-Tom
