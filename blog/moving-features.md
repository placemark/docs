Sometimes you'll get a dataset in which features are *not quite* in the right spot, and need a little nudge. You can now do that with Placemark! Just:

1. Select a feature - or features - by clicking on them.
2. Hold down the space bar.
3. Click & drag to move those features.

Simple as that. This also works with multi-selection, so if you need to move a whole swarm of points, you can do that too.
