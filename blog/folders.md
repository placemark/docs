You can now organize your maps into folder structures to make Placemark an even better home for your always-changing geospatial data!

‍

Plus, you can nest folders inside of each other for full-blown directory structures:

‍

To make it easier to navigate folders, find maps, and generally use Placemark, we've extended the search UI (which [was recently improved in the map view!](/post/changelog-november-21)) to work with the main page too! Just hit **Command+k** or click the Magnifying glass icon at the top of the map listing to activate it:

‍

So all together - folders can be nested, you can drag maps into them, or drag a map or folder onto the breadcrumbs to move it up a level.

‍

You can also toggle a folder tree and see a nested list of folders. A bunch of behaviors now integrate with folders: navigating back from a map that's in a folder will go back to that folder view rather than the home page. Deleting a folder will delete the maps inside of it. Combining maps will place the new, combined map inside of the source maps’s folder.

We think this is pretty cool - and thanks to the community for suggesting this feature!
