Placemark recently launched **Folders**! Folders let you organize the features in your maps.

You can create a folder of features that you want to use just as a reference when you're editing other things. Let's say you're working on a political project and want to keep in mind where the congressional districts lie. The congressional district polygons sit in a folder, which you can lock from editing and close in the folder tree, so you can focus on the dataset you're building.

Folders can be renamed and nested. You can put folders inside of folders. And everything that you do with folders, like everything else in the map, is updated in real-time and shared with your collaborators.

With the introduction of folders, we've also introduced ordering to maps. Using the folder tree on the left side of the page, you can drag features and folders to different places, and these changes are reflected in the map.

Folders work with import & export, too. At the export step, you can choose one folder in your map and just export those features. And when you import features from a file, the new features are automatically added to a new folder.

One of the many formats that Placemark supports is able to store folders: KML. So when you import KML files into Placemark, KML folders become Placemark folders. And you can export back to KML, preserving the folder structure. For the rest of the formats, you can export different files for different folders, or flatten your data when you export it, into one dataset.
