By default, every person who uses Placemark has a default organization and can add more members to that organization. Once you've added members, maps that you create are accessible to everyone in your organization. When you and a team member are editing the same map, your user avatars will appear in the top bar, and cursors will appear on the map.

For example - <strong>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.</strong></li><li>In multiple <strong>structured</strong> columns. For example, Address:&nbsp;<strong>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW</strong>, City: <strong>Washington, D.C.</strong></li></ul><h4>If your data is already structured in multiple columns, use the structured import</h4><p>Giving the geocoder the information that, ""Maryland"" is the state you're looking in rather than the name of a street or a point of interest will make geocoding results much more accurate.</p><h4>Try to clean and fix your data first</h4><p>When using addresses in import, try to clean your data and include as much information as possible. Even though we as people know that, say, ""1600 Pennsylvania Avenue"" is the White House's address, there are two different places with that address in Washington DC, plus locations with the same address in Baltimore, Brooklyn, and Pennsylvania.</p><h4>Be careful of missing data</h4><p>Another thing you'll see in address datasets is missing values. A volunteer might write ""No Address""&nbsp;for rows without an address, or worse, something like ""Somewhere in Maryland"". These, of course, aren't really places, and Placemark will produce features with null geometries given these inputs.</p>",guides,"Importing map data from addresses in CSV or Excel files is really powerful, but address are amongst the trickiest kinds of data.

To elaborate, let's say you want to show a map of US&nbsp;States with their average household incomes. It's reasonably simple to find geospatial data with the shapes of the US States by <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=us+states+geojson"" id="""">searching for ""us states geojson""</a>, and possible to find a CSV file of state demographic data, including income. But it's pretty hard to find an existing map data file that has both the shape of the states <strong id="""">and</strong> the income data as properties.</p><p id="""">In this way, you can often find geospatial data and tabular data that corresponds to the shapes in the geospatial data. What's missing is the ability to combine the two. That's what joining does.</p><h4 id="""">Requirements</h4><p id="""">To use this technique, you'll need two datasets: a geospatial dataset, like a GeoJSON file, or any of the other files supported with <a href=""/documentation/importing"" id="""">importing</a>, and a non-geospatial file in CSV or Excel formats.</p><p id="""">And very importantly, they need a <strong id="""">matching column</strong>. For example, a US&nbsp;States dataset might have state abbreviations like ""NY""&nbsp;and ""CA"", or a countries dataset would have ISO&nbsp;alpha-3 codes for countries, like ""USA""&nbsp;and ""CHN"". What's essential is that this column matches exactly between features on the map and in the dataset that you're joining to the map.</p><h4 id="""">How to join</h4><p id="""">Okay, so you've got the files. Now you can join data this way:</p><ol start="""" id=""""><li id="""">First, import the geospatial file to the map as you would normally.</li><li id="""">Then start importing the CSV of the non-geospatial data.</li><li id="""">Select ""<strong id="""">Join to geodata</strong>"" under the ""<strong id="""">Kind</strong>""&nbsp;option of the Import dialog.</li><li id="""">Select the columns to join against, both in the file to import and the map features.</li><li id="""">Click import.</li></ol><h4>Tutorial</h4><div></div><p>Want to follow this tutorial exactly?&nbsp;You can <a href=""https://gist.github.com/tmcw/d75fce82504b47819e8dd30a3531840d"">download the files I&nbsp;used from this page (click ""Download ZIP"" in the top right).</a></p><h4 id="""">What joining does</h4><p id="""">Joining matches rows in a CSV or XLS file to features on the map, by matching a specific column. When a row in the imported file matches a map feature, the data from that row is joined to the map feature: the data is merged with the feature's properties. If multiple map features match the same row, all of the map features will be joined. For example, if you're joining to countries based on the state's name, and an island nation is represented as multiple distinct Polygon geometries in multiple features (instead of being represented as a single MultiPolygon), then all of the matching features will receive the new properties.</p><p id="""">When a row doesn't match any map feature, the join operation will report this and list the non-matching rows.</p><p id="""">Joined properties that have the same name as existing properties will overwrite the existing properties.</p>",guides,"Joining lets you combine geospatial and non-geospatial data, thus multiplying the different datasets you can work with in Placemark."

Map features aren't just geometries, like a polygon in the shape of Manhattan, but also contain data that describes what that shape is, in the world. Properties are usually stored as pairs between a ""key"" and a ""value"", like key=name, value=Manhattan. You can think of this like rows in a spreadsheet - each column is a key, and each row has a value for each key.</p><h4 id="""">Properties are freeform</h4><p id="""">Another distinguishing fact about properties in geospatial data is that they're freeform. While some mapping tools will limit you to input a ""name""&nbsp;and ""description"", in the general sense any feature on a map can have any set of properties - any names and any values. Placemark embraces this fact and is not opinionated about properties names and values. One of your datasets might refer to things with a ""name"" property, another might use ""title""&nbsp;or ""id"". Any of the following will work.</p><h4 id="""">Properties are typed</h4><p id="""">Properties in geospatial data have <strong id="""">types</strong>. Any value that can be stored as JSON&nbsp;can be used, which includes:</p><ul><li>boolean (true &amp;&nbsp;false)</li><li>null</li><li>numbers</li><li>strings</li><li>arrays</li><li>objects</li></ul><p id="""">A given property might be a number, some text, as boolean value like true or false, or even a complex array or object for software to use. Placemark supports all property types that are valid in GeoJSON, which is one of the most permissive and flexibly-typed formats.</p><h4 id="""">Properties can be different for different features</h4><p id="""">While properties can be compared to rows in a table, they're more powerful than that. In a given dataset, different features can have different sets of properties. If one feature has a property like ""height=42"", other features can have a height property, or omit that property entirely. In this way, properties are more freeform that tables.</p><h4 id="""">Rich text properties</h4><p id="""">Placemark supports editing <a href=""/documentation/rich-text"" id="""">rich text properties</a>, which are represented as HTML in code but are edited with a friendly non-coding editor. You can upload images that'll be automatically hosted and shown in the rich text, as well as add styles like bold, link, strikethrough, and headings.</p><p>Rich text is stored as an object, like this:</p><div></div><p>When you're using Placemark, you won't have to worry about how rich text is stored, but when you're integrating data into a web map, you can look for the <strong>@type</strong> property to decide whether to display a value with HTML&nbsp;or plain-text.</p><h4>Casting properties</h4><p>Placemark supports casting properties, which means translating and re-interpreting them between different data types. For example, you might import data that contains numbers, but they're stored as strings. You can cast the values from string to numeric types to transform a value like ""100"" into the value 100.</p><h4>Colors</h4><p>The property editor will offer to edit string properties that look like colors with an interactive ""color wheel""&nbsp;editor for color values. The works by auto-detecting strings that look like CSS&nbsp;colors, like hex colors ( #f00 ) or rgb colors ( rgb(244, 244, 244) ).</p>",guides,"Properties are part of what makes geospatial data so powerful: features can contain data, not just shapes."

Some specifications require these coordinates to be ordered clockwise, others counter-clockwise. Winding order can be useful in some narrow circumstances to determine what's the ""outside"" of a Polygon (or MultiPolygon) and what is the inside.</p><h4 id="""">The Winding Order Option</h4><p id="""">Placemark gives you the choice of winding order for one format: GeoJSON. Other formats are either unopinionated about winding order or have a well-established standard for which order in which to wind coordinates.</p><p id="""">GeoJSON is unique, in that it has three ideas:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">In the original GeoJSON specification, there was no stipulation of winding order. You could wind rings however you'd like.</li><li id="""">In the fully-standardized revised GeoJSON&nbsp;specification (aka <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946"" id="""">RFC 7946</a>), polygons should follow the right-hand rule - exterior rings are counterclockwise, interior clockwise. However, for backward-compatibility, this is not required. Polygons with differently-wound coordinates should still work fine.</li><li id="""">The <a href=""https://github.com/d3/d3-geo"" id="""">d3-geo</a> tools require the <strong id="""">opposite</strong> of the specification - exterior rings should be clockwise wound. And if you have them incorrectly wound, then many functions in d3-geo will not function properly.</li></ul><h4>Spherical polygons</h4><p>The reason why d3-geo is so particular about winding order is that it supports spherical polygons - polygons that might cover the whole earth’s surface except for one small area. Imagine a polygon of all the earth except for a city outline:&nbsp;in this case the outer ring of that polygon has the same coordinates as a polygon covering just the city, but the polygon should be interpreted as everything <em>except</em> that area. Using winding order you can represent this. Placemark currently doesn't support this kind of polygon - you can represent this instead by creating a polygon with an outer ring of the full world extent and an inner ring of the city's shape.</p>",guides,An option to export GeoJSON from Placemark that is compatible with the d3-geo module

Unlike formats like <a href=""/documentation/geojson"">GeoJSON</a> or <a href=""/documentation/kml"">KML</a>, WKT can only store one feature at a time and has no way to store properties: formats that use WKT store properties in another way, like in other columns of a database table. In this sense, it's similar to the <a href=""/documentation/polyline"">Polyline</a> format, which can only store a single line - but WKT&nbsp;can store any kind of geometry.</p><p>Here's an example of a line encoded as WKT:</p><div></div><p>WKT is often stored and sometimes transferred as WKB, a binary version of the same format that has additional geometry types and is much more efficient to store and process.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry"">WKT on Wikipedia</a></li></ul>",formats,A text-based format that doesn't have the ability to contain attributes or metadata.

Data out in the world tends to use ZIP Codes, because people usually know which code they live in, and those codes track to something like a town or city area.</p><p>Geographers have a mixed relationship with the codes. They're designed for mail <em>routes</em>, to group houses in a certain order so that your mail carrier can efficiently deliver one neighborhood's mail at a time. So they're collections of house or addresses:&nbsp;a ZIP code doesn't have a specific area, it's a collection of points. There can be a group of houses with one ZIP code, and then a house with a different ZIP code right in the middle of those houses. This is something to be aware of when using ZIP&nbsp;codes. If you're deciding how to group data in the first place, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract"">Census Tracts</a> might be a better choice.</p><p>If you already have data with ZIP&nbsp;codes, you can import them in Placemark using the CSV&nbsp;importer, and choosing the ZIP code option. This will turn them into geographical centerpoints. ZIP&nbsp;codes change, year by year. Currently Placemark's ZIP database is based on the 2020 data released by the US&nbsp;Census.</p>",guides,The US's ZIP Codes are a way of roughly grouping addresses. Placemark supports importing them when they're included in a CSV file.
